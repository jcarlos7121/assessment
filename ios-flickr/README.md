# iOS Programmer - Exercise 1

Fork this project with the original description and write your own code.

Commit the important milestones and not just the final result!

## Excercise description

* Create a universal iOS 7 project in Xcode
* Write an application that
	* Loads the Flickr Interesting Images feed
	* Displays the images in the feed
* The app should
	* Not block
	* Cache the images locally
	* Display the content in a perfectly aligned grid that respects the device orientation and screen size
	* Use a horizontal grid size between 3 (iPhone portrait) and 5 (iPad landscape)
	* Display the current state to the user (loading, error)

# Notes

You can use libraries and SDK-s, but keep the project as simple and organized as possible.

Create a BUILD.md file explaining how to build your project if it's needed.
